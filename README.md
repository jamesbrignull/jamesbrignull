## Hello, I'm James
When I'm not building software... I'm pretending to be good at sports 🏀, I'm an eater of kiwis 🥝 (with the skin on 😱), reader of fantasy 🧙‍♂️, board game geek 🎲 (Pax Magnifica Bellum Gloriosum 🪐), and a slowly improving cook 👨‍🍳.
*All opinions are my own* - particularly the kiwi one
